%
% eegplugin_countingSheepPSG() - EEGLAB plugin for sleep scoring, event
% marking and signal processing.
%
% Usage:
%   >> eegplugin_countingSheepPSG(fig, trystrs, catchstrs)
%
% Inputs:
%   fig        - [integer] EEGLAB figure.
%   trystrs    - [struct] "try" strings for menu callbacks.
%   catchstrs  - [struct] "catch" strings for menu callbacks.
%
% See also:
%   countingSheepPSG, pop_countingSheepPSG, eeglab
%
% Dec 28, 2022: Version 1.0
%
% REQUIREMENTS:
% MATLAB version R2020a or later
% EEGlab 2020 or later (https://eeglab.org)
%
% USAGE:
% Customize display montage in:
% ~/montages/sleep_montage_default.m (rename and save to new file)
% Loads an EEGlab PSG dataset
%
% Works best if recording includes:
% - Recording start time event (at first data point)
% - Lights Off and Lights On events
%
% Sleep scoring keyboard shortcuts:
% 0 - Wake
% 1 - NREM 1
% 2 - NREM 2
% 3 - SWS
% 4 - REM
% . - Unscored
% backspace/delete - delete seelcted event(s)
%
% Event marking mode:
% Single-point events can be created using single mouse click
% Events with a duration can be created using mouse click-and-drag
% Enable 'all channels' mode to mark events without a channel
% Single-click existing event to select/deselect for delete/merge
