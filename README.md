# Counting Sheep PSG

EEGLAB-compatible manual sleep stage scoring, signal processing and event marking of polysomnographic (PSG) data for MATLAB.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.  

## Prerequisites

Mac, PC and Linux compatible.  
Designed for use with EEGLAB 2022 or later (https://eeglab.org) on Matlab R2020b or later (R2022b or later preferred).  
For use on continuous EEGLAB datasets (*.set).  

Works best if recording includes (in the EEG.event structure):  
* Recording start time event (at first data point)
* Lights Off and Lights On events

## Installing

Simply unzip 'countingSheepPSG' and add to Matlab path.  
Alternatively, unzip and move folder to '~/eeglab/plugins/' directory for EEGLAB GUI integration.  

## Usage

1. Customize display montage in:
~/montages/sleep_montage_default.m (rename and save to new file)
2. Loads an EEGlab PSG dataset for signal preprocessing and annnotation

### Supported Data Formats:

* EEGLAB Datasets (default)
* European Data Format (EDF)
* Brain Products Format (VHDR)

### Sleep Scoring Keyboard Shortcuts:

* 0 - Wake
* 1 - NREM 1
* 2 - NREM 2
* 3 - SWS
* 4 - REM
* . - Unscored
* backspace/delete - delete seelcted event(s)

### Event Marking Mode:

* Single-point events can be created using single mouse click
* Events with a duration can be created using mouse click-and-drag
* Enable 'all channels' mode to mark events without a channel
* Single-click existing event to select/deselect for delete/merge

### Signal processing (using built-in EEGlab functions)

* interpolate bad channels
* downsampling
* filtering
* re-referencing (beta)
* channel edit (beta)

### Automatic Event Detection:

* Automatic movement artifact detection
* Automatic spindle detection (using EEGlab 'detect_spindles' plugin)
* Automatic slow wave detection (using EEGlab 'PAA' plugin)
* Automatic rapid eye movement detection (coming soon...)
